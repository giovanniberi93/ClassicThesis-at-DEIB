\chapter{Experimental results} \label{chap:experimentalResults}

On the field experiments were a crucial point in the validation of \ac{GRAPE} system, for two main reasons:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item as explained in Section \ref{sec:grapeProjectDescription}, the research team included members both from Politecnico di Milano and Eurecat, that are located in two different countries. If if this should not have been a big problem, the division of labor created significant inefficiencies because:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item even if the sensor fusion and navigation parts were assigned to Politecnico, the Husky \ac{UGV} was property of Eurecat, so it was in Barcellone
		\item even if the analysis of the vine scan in order to detect the most suitable deployment point was in charge of Eurecat, the arm was property of Politecnico so it was in Milano.
	\end{itemize}
	This problem was mitigated by the loggin tool of \ac{ROS} (\textit{rosbag} package we mentioned in Section \ref{sec:robotOperatingSystem}), that demonstrated its potential in such a situation.
\end{enumerate}
